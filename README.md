# Friend Finder Application
Friend Finder is an app that matches a user to another user based on the user's responses to a ten question survey. The user responds to questions on a scale of 1-5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees. When the survey is submitted, a comparison is performed between the new user and the users in record for the closest match. The closest set of user responses is defined as the set with the lowest absolute difference for all ten questions combined.

The application is made using a Node.js and Express server on the back-end and is using Bootstrap 4 for the front-end.
